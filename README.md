# CreativeMode Reborn

## Description

Finally the end of a long day of cooking, and the Appliance you wanted just didn't appear?
Now you can ask for anything you want!

## Usage

To toggle the menu on and off, you can use the `F1` key on your keyboard.

To spawn an Appliance, simply click on the button with it's name, if you can't find it you can use the search bar at the top.

If the Appliance you're looking for doesn't actually have a name to search, you can manually enter the ID at the bottom
